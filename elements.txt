added first dplyr command - select...to whittle data down to columns that will be used
in data series.

reviewed data pulled from first set of commands, determined it insufficient for analysis.

Created new dataframe with select/filter sequence to pull data for magma source review.

pulled new data set from PetDB with filters "Sample Type" = igneous volcanic mafic
with subsets of alkali basalt, tholeiite, trachyte and trachytebasalt with hopes more information will be available for analysis

narrowed down the table to the columns most needed and then filtered for alkali and tholeiite
then did a count to see if there were enough of those to compare - THERE ARE

saved code and recommitting/pushing
